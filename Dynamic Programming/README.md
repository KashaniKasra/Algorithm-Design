## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing and analyzing various **Dynamic Programming** algorithms. Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations.

### Key Features:
1. **Overlapping Subproblems**: Problems are broken into smaller subproblems which are solved independently.
2. **Optimal Substructure**: The solution of a problem depends on the solutions of its subproblems.
3. **Memoization**: Results of subproblems are stored to avoid re-computation.

## Algorithms Implemented:
- Fibonacci Sequence
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- Knapsack Problem
- Matrix Chain Multiplication
- Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance)
