## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing and analyzing the **Divide and Conquer** algorithmic approach. The divide and conquer technique is used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems, solving each sub-problem independently, and then combining the solutions to solve the original problem.

### Key Features:
1. **Divide**: Break the problem into smaller sub-problems of the same type.
2. **Conquer**: Solve the sub-problems recursively or directly if they are small enough.
3. **Combine**: Combine the solutions of the sub-problems to solve the original problem.

## Algorithm Implemented:
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Binary Search
- Matrix Multiplication using Strassenâ€™s Algorithm
