## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing and analyzing various **Greedy Algorithms**. Greedy algorithms make a series of choices, each of which looks the best at the moment, with the hope that these local optimizations will lead to a global optimum.

### Key Features:
1. **Greedy Choice Property**: The choice that looks best at the moment is made at each step.
2. **Optimal Substructure**: The optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems.

## Algorithms Implemented:
- Activity Selection Problem
- Huffman Coding
- Fractional Knapsack Problem
- Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Prim's Algorithm
- Job Sequencing with Deadlines
