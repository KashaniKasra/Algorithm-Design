## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing and analyzing various **Graph Algorithms**. Graph algorithms are used to solve problems related to graphs, which consist of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them. These algorithms help in traversing, searching, and finding optimal paths in graphs.

### Key Features:
1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using adjacency lists or matrices.
2. **Traversal Algorithms**: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) are used to explore the graph.
3. **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford, and Floyd-Warshall are implemented to find the shortest path in weighted graphs.
4. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms are used to find the minimum spanning tree of the graph.
