## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing and analyzing various **NP-Complete** problems. NP-Complete problems are computationally hard problems for which no polynomial-time solution is known. The project aims to provide approximate or heuristic solutions for such problems.

### Key Features:
1. **Exponential Time Complexity**: These problems are computationally intensive and grow exponentially with input size.
2. **Heuristic Solutions**: Since exact solutions are often impractical for large inputs, heuristic or approximate algorithms are implemented to solve these problems efficiently.

## Problems Implemented:
- Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
- Knapsack Problem
- Hamiltonian Path Problem
- Vertex Cover Problem
- Graph Coloring
